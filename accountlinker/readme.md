# Account Linker
## This is specifically designed to integrate with RMC's Patreon system! If you don't have that, this is useless to you.

Type `/linkersetdb` to get started. Redbot handles slash commands weirdly, so you'll likely need to enable slash commands for the cog and resync them.

Afterwards you can run `[p]linksetup` to setup the modal message, like below.

Users can then use `[p]checklink` and `[p]unlinkaccount` to do as the command names imply.
